# Check PRP Status

Display the current execution status of a PRP file.

## PRP File: $ARGUMENTS

## Status Check Process

1. **Load PRP and State**
   - Read the specified PRP file
   - Load corresponding state file: `{prp-name}.state`
   - If no state file: Report "Not started"

2. **Display Status Information**
   - **Overall Progress**: X/Y tasks completed (Z% complete)
   - **Current Task**: Task number and description
   - **Completed Tasks**: List with timestamps and commit hashes
   - **Failed Tasks**: List with error descriptions
   - **Last Activity**: When was last task completed
   - **Git Status**: Current branch and last PRP-related commit

3. **Status Report Format**

4. **Validation Checks**
   - Verify state file consistency with Git history

   - Report any inconsistencies or issues

5. **Action Recommendations**
   - If execution can be resumed: Suggest `/prp-resume`

   - If completed: Show final validation status

## Error Handling

- **No state file**: "PRP not started. Use `/execute-prp` to begin."
- **Corrupted state**: "State file corrupted. Recovery options: [list]"
- **Git mismatch**: "Git history inconsistent with state. Manual review needed."
